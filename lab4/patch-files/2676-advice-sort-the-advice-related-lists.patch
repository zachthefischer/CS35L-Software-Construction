Subject: [PATCH 2676/2871] advice: sort the advice related lists
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Let's keep the advice related lists sorted to make them more
digestible.

A multi-line comment has also been changed; that produces the unexpected
'insertion != deletion' in this supposedly 'only sort lines' commit.
