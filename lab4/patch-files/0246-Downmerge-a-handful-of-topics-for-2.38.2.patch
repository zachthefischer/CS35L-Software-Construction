+Git 2.38.2 Release Notes
+========================
+
+This is to backport various fixes accumulated during the development
+towards Git 2.39, the next feature release.
+
+
+Fixes since v2.38.1
+-------------------
+
+ * Update CodingGuidelines to clarify what features to use and avoid
+   in C99.
+
+ * The codepath that reads from the index v4 had unaligned memory
+   accesses, which has been corrected.
+
+ * "git remote rename" failed to rename a remote without fetch
+   refspec, which has been corrected.
+
+ * "git clone" did not like to see the "--bare" and the "--origin"
+   options used together without a good reason.
+
+ * Fix messages incorrectly marked for translation.
+
+ * "git fsck" failed to release contents of tree objects already used
+   from the memory, which has been fixed.
+
+ * "git rebase -i" can mistakenly attempt to apply a fixup to a commit
+   itself, which has been corrected.
+
+ * In read-only repositories, "git merge-tree" tried to come up with a
+   merge result tree object, which it failed (which is not wrong) and
+   led to a segfault (which is bad), which has been corrected.
+
+ * Force C locale while running tests around httpd to make sure we can
+   find expected error messages in the log.
+
+ * Fix a logic in "mailinfo -b" that miscomputed the length of a
+   substring, which lead to an out-of-bounds access.
+
+ * The codepath to sign learned to report errors when it fails to read
+   from "ssh-keygen".
+
+ * "GIT_EDITOR=: git branch --edit-description" resulted in failure,
+   which has been corrected.
+
+Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.
