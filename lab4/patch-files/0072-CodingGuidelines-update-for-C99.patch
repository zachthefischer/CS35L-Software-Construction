Subject: [PATCH 0072/2871] CodingGuidelines: update for C99
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since 7bc341e21b5 (git-compat-util: add a test balloon for C99
support, 2021-12-01) we've had a hard dependency on C99, but the prose
in CodingGuidelines was written under the assumption that we were
using C89 with a few C99 features.

As the updated prose notes we'd still like to hold off on novel C99
features, but let's make it clear that we target that C version, and
then enumerate new C99 features that are safe to use.
