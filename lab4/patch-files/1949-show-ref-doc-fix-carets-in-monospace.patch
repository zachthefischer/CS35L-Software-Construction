Subject: [PATCH 1949/2871] show-ref doc: fix carets in monospace
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When commit 00bf685975 (show-ref doc: update for internal consistency,
2023-05-19) switched from double quotes to backticks around our {caret}
macro, we started rendering "{caret}" literally. Fix this by replacing
by a "^" character.
