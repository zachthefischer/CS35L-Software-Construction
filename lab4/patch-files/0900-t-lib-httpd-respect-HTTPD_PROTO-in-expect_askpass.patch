Subject: [PATCH 0900/2871] t/lib-httpd: respect $HTTPD_PROTO in
 expect_askpass()

When the HTTP tests are run with LIB_HTTPD_SSL in the environment, then
we access the test server as https://. This causes expect_askpass to
complain, because it tries to blindly match "http://" in the prompt
shown to the user. We can adjust this to use $HTTPD_PROTO, which is set
during the setup phase.

Note that this is enough for t5551 and t5559 to pass when run with
https, but there are similar problems in other scripts that will need to
be fixed before the whole suite can run with LIB_HTTPD_SSL.
