Subject: [PATCH 2678/2871] branch: make the advice to force-deleting a
 conditional one
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The error message we show when the user tries to delete a not fully
merged branch describes the error and gives a hint to the user:

	error: the branch 'foo' is not fully merged.
	If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D foo'.

Let's move the hint part so that it is displayed using the advice
machinery:

	error: the branch 'foo' is not fully merged
	hint: If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D foo'
	hint: Disable this message with "git config advice.forceDeleteBranch false"
