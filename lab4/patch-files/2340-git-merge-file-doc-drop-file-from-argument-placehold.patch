Subject: [PATCH 2340/2871] git-merge-file doc: drop "-file" from argument
 placeholders
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

`git merge-file` takes three positional arguments. Each of them is
documented as `<foo-file>`. In preparation for teaching this command to
alternatively take three object IDs, make these placeholders a bit more
generic by dropping the "-file" parts. Instead, clarify early that the
three arguments are filenames. Even after the next commit, we can afford
to present this file-centric view up front and in the general
discussion, since it will remain the default one.
