Subject: [PATCH 0551/2871] commit: skip already cleared parents in
 clear_commit_marks_1()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Don't put clean parents on the pending list, as they and their ancestors
don't need any treatment and would be skipped later anyway.  This saves
the allocation and release of a commit list item in ca. 20% of the cases
during a run of the test suite.
