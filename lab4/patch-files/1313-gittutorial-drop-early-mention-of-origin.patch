Subject: [PATCH 1313/2871] gittutorial: drop early mention of origin
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We don't have an origin at this point in the tutorial, so "Your branch
is up to date" won't actually show up in the output of `git status`.

This line was introduced in 8942821ec0 ("gittutorial: fix output of 'git
status'", 2014-11-13) in what looks like a mistake -- that commit mostly
just wanted to remove leading '#' characters.
