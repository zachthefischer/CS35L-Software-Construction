Subject: [PATCH 0028/2871] revisions.txt: unspecify order of resolved parts of
 ^!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

gitrevisions(7) says that <rev>^! resolves to <rev> and then all the
parents of <rev>.  revision.c::handle_revision_arg_1() actually adds
all parents first, then <rev>.  Change the documentation to leave the
order unspecified, to avoid misleading readers.
