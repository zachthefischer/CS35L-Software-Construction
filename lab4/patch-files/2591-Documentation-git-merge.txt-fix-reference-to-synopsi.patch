Subject: [PATCH 2591/2871] Documentation/git-merge.txt: fix reference to
 synopsis
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

437591a9d738 combined the synopsis of "The second syntax" (meaning `git
merge --abort`) and "The third syntax" (for `git merge --continue`) into
this single line:

       git merge (--continue | --abort | --quit)

but it was still referred to when describing the preconditions that have
to be fulfilled to run the respective actions. In other words:
References by number are no longer valid after a merge of some of the
synopses.

Also the previous version of the documentation did not acknowledge that
`--no-commit` would result in the precondition being fulfilled (thanks
to Elijah Newren and Junio C Hamano for pointing that out).

This change also groups `--abort` and `--continue` together when
explaining the prerequisites in order to avoid duplication.

-The second syntax ("`git merge --abort`") can only be run after the

+A merge stops if there's a conflict that cannot be resolved

 *Warning*: Running 'git merge' with non-trivial uncommitted changes is
 discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that is hard to
 back out of in the case of a conflict.
