Subject: [PATCH 1599/2871] ls-tree: fix documentation of %x format placeholder
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

ls-tree --format expands %x followed by two hexadecimal digits to the
character indicated by that hexadecimal number, e.g.:

   $ git ls-tree --format=%x41 HEAD | head -1
   A

It rejects % followed by a hexadecimal digit, e.g.:

   $ git ls-tree --format=%41 HEAD | head -1
   fatal: bad ls-tree format: element '41' does not start with '('

This functionality is provided by strbuf_expand_literal_cb(), which has
not been changed since it was factored out by fd2015b323 (strbuf:
separate callback for strbuf_expand:ing literals, 2019-01-28).

Adjust the documentation accordingly.
