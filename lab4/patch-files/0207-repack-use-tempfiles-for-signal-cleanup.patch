Subject: [PATCH 0207/2871] repack: use tempfiles for signal cleanup
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When git-repack exits due to a signal, it tries to clean up by calling
its remove_temporary_files() function, which walks through the packs dir
looking for ".tmp-$$-pack-*" files to delete (where "$$" is the pid of
the current process).

The biggest problem here is that remove_temporary_files() is not safe to
call in a signal handler. It uses opendir(), which isn't on the POSIX
async-signal-safe list. The details will be platform-specific, but a
likely issue is that it needs to allocate memory; if we receive a signal
while inside malloc(), etc, we'll conflict on the allocator lock and
deadlock with ourselves.

We can fix this by just cleaning up the files directly, without walking
the directory. We already know the complete list of .tmp-* files that
were generated, because we recorded them via populate_pack_exts(). When
we find files there, we can use register_tempfile() to record the
filenames. If we receive a signal, then the tempfile API will clean them
up for us, and it's async-safe and pretty battle-tested.

Note that this is slightly racier than the existing scheme. We don't
record the filenames until pack-objects tells us the hash over stdout.
So during the period between it generating the file and reporting the
hash, we'd fail to clean up. However, that period is very small. During
most of the pack generation process pack-objects is using its own
internal tempfiles. It's only at the very end that it moves them into
the names git-repack expects, and then it immediately reports the name
to us. Given that cleanup like this is best effort (after all, we may
get SIGKILL), this level of race is acceptable.

When we register the tempfiles, we'll record them locally and use the
result to call rename_tempfile(), rather than renaming by hand.  This
isn't strictly necessary, as once we've renamed the files they're gone,
and the tempfile API's cleanup unlink() would simply become a pointless
noop. But managing the lifetimes of the tempfile objects is the cleanest
thing to do, and the tempfile pointers naturally fill the same role as
the old booleans.

This patch also fixes another small problem. We only hook signals, and
don't set up an atexit handler. So if we see an error that causes us to
die(), we'll leave the .tmp-* files in place. But since the tempfile API
handles this for us, this is now fixed for free. The new test covers
this by stimulating a failure of pack-objects when generating a cruft
pack. Before this patch, the .tmp-* file for the main pack would have
been left, but now we correctly clean it up.

Two small subtleties on the implementation:

  - in the renaming loop, we can stop re-constructing fname_old; we only
    use it when we have a tempfile to rename, so we can just ask the
    tempfile for its path (which, barring bugs, should be identical)

  - when renaming fails, our error message mentions fname_old. But since
    a failed rename_tempfile() invalidates the tempfile struct, we'll
    lose access to that string. Instead, let's mention the destination
    filename, which is what most other callers do.
