Subject: [PATCH 2689/2871] completion: improve existence check for pseudo-refs
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Improve the existence check along the following lines:

  - Stop stripping the "ref :" prefix and compare to the expected value
    directly. This allows us to drop a now-unused variable that was
    previously leaking into the user's shell.

  - Mark the "head" variable as local so that we don't leak its value
    into the user's shell.

  - Stop manually handling the `-C $__git_repo_path` option, which the
    `__git ()` wrapper aleady does for us.

  - In simlar spirit, stop redirecting stderr, which is also handled by
    the wrapper already.
