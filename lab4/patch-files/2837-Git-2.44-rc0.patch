  * The way CI testing used "prove" could lead to running the test
    suite twice needlessly, which has been corrected.

    (ab)use of it in "git send-email".  Bump the minimum version
    requirement for Perl to 5.8.1 (from September 2002) to allow
    simplifying our implementation.
-   (merge 6ff658cc78 tz/send-email-negatable-options later to maint).
 
  * Earlier we stopped relying on commit-graph that (still) records
    information about commits that are lost from the object store,
    which has negative performance implications.  The default has been
    flipped to disable this pessimization.
-   (merge b1df3b3867 ps/commit-graph-less-paranoid later to maint).
 
  * Stale URLs have been updated to their current counterparts (or
    archive.org) and HTTP links are replaced with working HTTPS links.
-   (merge 62b4f7b9c6 js/update-urls-in-doc-and-comment later to maint).
 
  * trace2 streams used to record the URLs that potentially embed
    authentication material, which has been corrected.
-   (merge 16fa3eebc0 jh/trace2-redact-auth later to maint).
 
  * The sample pre-commit hook that tries to catch introduction of new
    paths that use potentially non-portable characters did not notice
    an existing path getting renamed to such a problematic path, when
    rename detection was enabled.
-   (merge d9fd71fa2a jp/use-diff-index-in-pre-commit-sample later to maint).
 
  * The command line parser for the "log" family of commands was too
    loose when parsing certain numbers, e.g., silently ignoring the
    extra 'q' in "git log -n 1q" without complaining, which has been
    tightened up.
-   (merge 71a1e94821 jc/revision-parse-int later to maint).
 
  * "git $cmd --end-of-options --rev -- --path" for some $cmd failed
    to interpret "--rev" as a rev, and "--path" as a path.  This was
    fixed for many programs like "reset" and "checkout".
-   (merge 9385174627 jk/end-of-options later to maint).
 
  * "git bisect reset" has been taught to clean up state files and refs
    even when BISECT_START file is gone.
-   (merge daaa03e54c jk/bisect-reset-fix later to maint).
 
  * Some codepaths did not correctly parse configuration variables
    specified with valueless "true", which has been corrected.
-   (merge d49cb162fa jk/implicit-true later to maint).
 
  * Code clean-up for sanity checking of command line options for "git
    show-ref".
-   (merge 7382497372 rs/show-ref-incompatible-options later to maint).
 
  * The code to parse the From e-mail header has been updated to avoid
    recursion.
-   (merge dee182941f jk/mailinfo-iterative-unquote-comment later to maint).
 
  * "git fetch --atomic" issued an unnecessary empty error message,
    which has been corrected.
-   (merge 18ce48918c jx/fetch-atomic-error-message-fix later to maint).
 
  * Command line completion script (in contrib/) learned to work better
    with the reftable backend.
-   (merge 44dbb3bf29 sh/completion-with-reftable later to maint).
 
  * "git status" is taught to show both the branch being bisected and
    being rebased when both are in effect at the same time.
-   (merge 990adccbdf rj/status-bisect-while-rebase later to maint).
 
  * "git archive --list extra garbage" silently ignored excess command
    line parameters, which has been corrected.
-   (merge d6b6cd1393 jc/archive-list-with-extra-args later to maint).
 
  * "git sparse-checkout set" added default patterns even when the
    patterns are being fed from the standard input, which has been
    corrected.
-   (merge 53ded839ae jc/sparse-checkout-set-default-fix later to maint).
 
  * "git sparse-checkout (add|set) --[no-]cone --end-of-options" did

  * Clearing in-core repository (happens during e.g., "git fetch
