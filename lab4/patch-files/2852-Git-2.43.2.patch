+Git 2.43.2 Release Notes
+========================
+
+Relative to Git 2.43.1, this release has two important fixes to allow
+"git imap-send" to be built with NO_CURL defined, and to restore the
+forced flushing behaviour when GIT_FLUSH=1 is set.  It also contains
+other, unexciting, fixes that have already been merged to the 'master'
+branch of the development towards the next major release.
+
+Fixes since Git 2.43.1
+----------------------
+
+ * Update to a new feature recently added, "git show-ref --exists".
+
+ * Rename detection logic ignored the final line of a file if it is an
+   incomplete line.
+
+ * "git diff --no-rename A B" did not disable rename detection but did
+   not trigger an error from the command line parser.
+
+ * "git diff --no-index file1 file2" segfaulted while invoking the
+   external diff driver, which has been corrected.
+
+ * Rewrite //-comments to /* comments */ in files whose comments
+   prevalently use the latter.
+
+ * A failed "git tag -s" did not necessarily result in an error
+   depending on the crypto backend, which has been corrected.
+
+ * "git stash" sometimes was silent even when it failed due to
+   unwritable index file, which has been corrected.
+
+ * Recent conversion to allow more than 0/1 in GIT_FLUSH broke the
+   mechanism by flipping what yes/no means by mistake, which has been
+   corrected.
+
+Also contains documentation updates, code clean-ups and minor fixups.
