Subject: [PATCH 0952/2871] rebase: refuse to switch to a branch already
 checked out elsewhere (test)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In b5cabb4a9 (rebase: refuse to switch to branch already checked out
elsewhere, 2020-02-23) we add a condition to prevent a rebase operation
involving a switch to a branch that is already checked out in another
worktree.

A bug has recently been fixed that caused this to not work as expected.

Let's add a test to notice if this changes in the future.
