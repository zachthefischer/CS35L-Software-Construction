Subject: [PATCH 1887/2871] docs: update when `git bisect visualize` uses
 `gitk`
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This check has involved more environment variables than just `DISPLAY` since
508e84a790 (bisect view: check for MinGW32 and MacOSX in addition to X11,
2008-02-14), so let's update the documentation accordingly.
