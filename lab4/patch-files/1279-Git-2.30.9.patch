+Git v2.30.9 Release Notes
+=========================
+
+This release addresses the security issues CVE-2023-25652,
+CVE-2023-25815, and CVE-2023-29007.
+
+
+Fixes since v2.30.8
+-------------------
+
+ * CVE-2023-25652:
+
+   By feeding specially crafted input to `git apply --reject`, a
+   path outside the working tree can be overwritten with partially
+   controlled contents (corresponding to the rejected hunk(s) from
+   the given patch).
+
+ * CVE-2023-25815:
+
+   When Git is compiled with runtime prefix support and runs without
+   translated messages, it still used the gettext machinery to
+   display messages, which subsequently potentially looked for
+   translated messages in unexpected places. This allowed for
+   malicious placement of crafted messages.
+
+ * CVE-2023-29007:
+
+   When renaming or deleting a section from a configuration file,
+   certain malicious configuration values may be misinterpreted as
+   the beginning of a new configuration section, leading to arbitrary
+   configuration injection.
+
+Credit for finding CVE-2023-25652 goes to Ry0taK, and the fix was
+developed by Taylor Blau, Junio C Hamano and Johannes Schindelin,
+with the help of Linus Torvalds.
+
+Credit for finding CVE-2023-25815 goes to Maxime Escourbiac and
+Yassine BENGANA of Michelin, and the fix was developed by Johannes
+Schindelin.
+
+Credit for finding CVE-2023-29007 goes to André Baptista and Vítor Pinho
+of Ethiack, and the fix was developed by Taylor Blau, and Johannes
+Schindelin, with help from Jeff King, and Patrick Steinhardt.
