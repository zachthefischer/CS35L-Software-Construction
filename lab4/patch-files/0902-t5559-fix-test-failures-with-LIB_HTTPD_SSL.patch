Subject: [PATCH 0902/2871] t5559: fix test failures with LIB_HTTPD_SSL

One test needs to be tweaked in order for t5559 to pass with SSL/TLS set
up. When we make our initial clone, we check that the curl trace of
requests is what we expected. But we need to fix two things:

  - along with ignoring "data" lines from the trace, we need to ignore
    "SSL data" lines

  - when TLS is used, the server is able to tell the client (via ALPN)
    that it supports HTTP/2 before the first HTTP request is made. So
    rather than request an upgrade using an HTTP header, it can just
    speak HTTP/2 immediately

With this patch, running:

  LIB_HTTPD_SSL=1 ./t5559-http-fetch-smart-http2.sh

works, whereas it did not before.
