Subject: [PATCH 2654/2871] branch: clarify <oldbranch> term
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since 52d59cc645 (branch: add a --copy (-c) option to go with --move
(-m), 2017-06-18) <oldbranch> is used in more operations than just -m.

Let's also clarify what we do if <oldbranch> is omitted.
