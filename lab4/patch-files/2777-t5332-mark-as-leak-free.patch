Subject: [PATCH 2777/2871] t5332: mark as leak-free
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This test is leak-free since it was added in af626ac0e0 (pack-bitmap:
enable reuse from all bitmapped packs, 2023-12-14).

Let's mark it as leak-free to make sure it stays that way (and to reduce
noise when looking for other leak-free scripts after we fix some leaks).
