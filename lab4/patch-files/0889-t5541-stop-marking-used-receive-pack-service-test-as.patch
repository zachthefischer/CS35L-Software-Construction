Subject: [PATCH 0889/2871] t5541: stop marking "used receive-pack service"
 test as v0 only

We have a test which checks to see if a request to git-receive-pack was
made. Originally, it was checking the entire set of requests made in the
script so far, including clones, and thus it would break when run with
the v2 protocol (since that implies an extra request for fetches).

Since the previous commit, though, we are only checking the requests
made by a single push. And since there is no v2 push protocol, the test
now passes no matter what's in GIT_TEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION. We can just
run it all the time.
