Running $ git branch reveals that the branches of the eggert SEASnet repository are:
  maint
* master
  next
  seen
  todo
and the branch of the local repository is just:
* master

The remote repository has additional "remote tracking branches", maint, next, seen, and todo. Having a remote repository allows multiple developers to contribute separately to one workflow. "A maintainer can add a repository as remote, test the changes locally, and merge them into their branch, and push back to their repository"


ALSO
Running $ git branch -a to reveal the remote tracking branches as well as the local file.
The eggert repository looks like:
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/jch
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/maint
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/next
  remotes/origin/seen
  remotes/origin/todo
and the local repository looks like:
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/jch
  remotes/origin/maint
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/next
  remotes/origin/seen
  remotes/origin/todo

These are the same except for the eggert repository's
  remotes/origin/main
