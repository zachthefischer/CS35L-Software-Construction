This shows that the author is Arthur David Olson and the file is northamerica


I can then run
$ git blame northamerica | grep "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."
c8f960ec7 (Paul Eggert        2013-09-02 08:09:06 -0700  900) # and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory 

This gives me the commit hash of the when it was last modified - 2013-09-02 (which is interesting but not exactly what we're looking for)

I tried running
$ git log --follow northamerica
Which showed the history of the file (scrolling down to find the original 1995 commit), but the commit messages were not up to standard and didn't provide much information.

Doing a quick Google search for "Arthur David Olson Paul Eggert" reveals a law suit filed on September 30th, 2011, in which Astrolabe Inc. argued that Olson and Eggert infringed on their copywrite of the ACS Atlas.


I also tried
$ git show c12b432741eed9a422fbf99fa27af6e7a941d88b
(which is the commit hash from the Dec 21, 1995 commit), which revealed the diff file for this commit. I scrolled through until I found the line "Even newspapers..."

+# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
+# Indiana generally observes either EST all year, or CST/CDT,
+# but areas near Cincinnati and Louisville use those cities' timekeeping
+# and in 1969 and 1970 the whole state observed daylight time;
+# and there are other exceptions as noted below.
+# Shanks partitions Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
+# and writes ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''
+# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
+#
+# Since 1970, EST-only Indiana has been like America/Indianapolis,
+# with exceptions noted below for Crawford, Starke, and Switzerland counties.
+# The parts of Indiana not listed below have been like America/Chicago,
+# America/Louisville, or America/New_York.
+#
+# Other than Indianapolis, the Indiana place names are so nondescript
+# that they would be ambiguous if we left them at the `America' level.
+# So we reluctantly put them all in a subdirectory `America/Indiana'.


So, even though the commit was from Olson, it looks like he was adding in a quote from Eggert, in which Eggert was quoting "Shanks".

I checked if they cited ACS Atlas with
$ git log -S "ACS Atlas"
$ git log -S "ACS American Atlas"
$ git log -S "ACS International Atlas"
But didn't find anything until
$ git log -S "ACS "

This came up with a commit hash on the same file! I should have just read the first few lines, because it says

+# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1995-12-19):
+# A good source for time zone historical data in the US is
+# Thomas G. Shanks, The American Atlas (5th edition),
+# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).

So... it looks like the sentence in question was introduced by change committed by Olson but originally written by Eggert. Either way, it still cites ACS Publications.

After doing some more digging, I found another document from the case that dismisses the matter "WITH PREJUDICE & WITHOUT COSTS". (https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2012/02/astrolabedroppedcase.pdf)

And everyone lived happily every after.
